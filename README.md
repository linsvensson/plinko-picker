## 💡 About Plinko Picker

Say goodbye to boring popsicle sticks, random number generators, and standard spinner wheels! **Plinko Picker** was designed from the ground up to inject energy, excitement, and a little bit of beautiful chaos into the classroom. 

Whether you need to call on a student, pick a winner for a game, or just want to build suspense, Plinko Picker turns a simple task into a classroom-wide event. Watch as student names (assigned to random emojis) bounce, tumble, dodge obstacles, and race their way to the bottom!

## 📖 How to Use

### 🧑‍🎓 Step 1 — Add Students
Simply open the app and paste your student list, type it manually, or upload a `.csv` or `.txt` file. The app automatically reformats "Last, First" into "First Last" and resolves duplicates gracefully.

---

### ⚖️ Step 1b — Weight the Odds (Optional)
Add a multiplier after a name to change how likely that person is to win:

```
Alice
Bob x0.5     ← half as likely
Cleo x2      ← twice as likely
```

Leave a name bare for normal odds. Weights are saved with the class and survive a `.csv` round trip. The effect is a nudge, not a guarantee — a weighted-down student can still win, which is rather the point.

---

### 💾 Step 2 — Save Your Roster (Optional)
Click **Save** to remember your class for next time. The app remembers multiple class periods and rosters directly in your browser.

---

### ⏱️ Step 3 — Set the Timer
Choose how long you want the race to last using the slider. You can set it anywhere from a quick 10 seconds to an agonizing 120-second marathon.

---

### 🚀 Step 4 — Start the Race!
Hit the **🚀 Start the Race!** button, toggle the music, and watch the chaos unfold as student emojis bounce and tumble their way to the finish line!

## 👨‍🏫 Note from the Creator

*As a full-time high school teacher, I know how hard it can be to keep students engaged every day. Sometimes, all it takes is turning a mundane classroom procedure—like calling on someone—into a spectacle. I built Plinko Picker to give my students an excuse to cheer, laugh, and lean forward in their seats. I hope it brings the same joy to your classroom!*
